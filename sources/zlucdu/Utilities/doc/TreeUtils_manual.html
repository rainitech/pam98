<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The Tree Utilities Library contains general classes to build a hierarchical list of items, a so-called object tree. The original Delphi VCL classes TTreeNodes and TTreeNode were often too specific for my tasks. When I realized that I was repeatedly implementing special purpose trees which more or less do the same job, it was time to look for a more general approach and to implement basic tree-structure classes, which make it easy to derive new specialized ones. The result of this project is the Tree Utilities Library. The latest version of this software is available at &lt;<a href="http://www.philo.de/xml/">http://www.philo.de/xml/</a>&gt;.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Using the unit</h4>

<p>The Tree Utilities Library does not contain any components to be registered. So using it from inside your own projects is very simple: Add "TreeUtils" to the uses clause of your unit and make sure that the path to the location of the TreeUtils.pas file is included in Delphi's list of library paths. To include it go to the Library section of Delphi's Environment Options dialog (see the menu item: "Tools/Environment Options ...").</p>

<hr />

<h4>Exceptions</h4>

<p>All exceptions raised inside the TreeUtils Library are derived from Delphi's EListError exception.</p>

<ul>
<li>EHierarchyRequestError = class(EListError);</li>
<li>ENoModificationAllowedError = class(EListError);</li>
<li>ENotAssignedError = class(EListError);</li>
<li>ENotFoundError = class(EListError);</li>
<li>EWrongOwnerError = class(EListError);</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>Defined Resourcestrings</h4>

<p>These strings are used for the error messages of the corresponding exceptions.</p>

<ul>
<li>SHierarchyRequestError = 'Hierarchy Request Error';</li>
<li>SNoModificationAllowedError = 'No Modification Allowed Error';</li>
<li>SNotAssignedError = 'Parameter Node Not Assigned Error';</li>
<li>SNotFoundError = 'Node Not Found Error.';</li>
<li>SWrongOwnerError = 'Wrong Owner Error';</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>TCustomOwnedObject = class(TPersistent)</h4>

<p>TCustomOwnedObject is a simple extension of the TPersistent class for maintaining a set of owned objects. The owner of a newly created TCustomOwnedObject object (if any) is specified in the new object's constructor and is then automatically added to the specified TCustomOwnedObject object's list of owned objects. When a TCustomOwnedObject object is freed, all of its owned objects are (recursively) freed too and it is automatically removed from is owner object's list of owned objects. It is also possible to specify nil as the owner parameter of a node's constructor. In this case the node has no owner node and the application is responsibly of correctly freeing it.</p>

<p>Do not create instances of TCustomOwnedObject. Instead use it to define your own descendant classes. Most of the properties and methods defined in TCustomOwnedObject are protected so that you can choose whether to hide or publish them in your own classes.</p>

<h5>Protected Properties</h5>

<h6>OwnedObject[Index: Integer]: TCustomOwnedObject (readonly)</h6>

<p>Lists all owned object. The first item has an index of 0, the second an index of 1, and so on.</p>

<h6>OwnedObjectsCount: Integer (readonly)</h6>

<p>The number of owned objects.</p>


<h5>Public Methods</h5>

<h6>constructor Create(const AOwner: TCustomOwnedObject);</h6>

<p>Constructs and initializes an instance of TCustomOwnedObject. If an owner node was specified, the new object is added to the specified owner's list of owned objects.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>AOwner<br />The object that owns the new instance of TCustomOwnedObject or nil if the new instance has no owner.</li>
</ul>

<h6>destructor Destroy; override;</h6>

<p>Destroys an instance of TCustomOwnedObject and removes it from its owner's list of owned objects. Do not call Destroy directly in an application. Instead, call Free. Free verifies that the TCustomOwnedObject reference is not nil, and only then calls Destroy.</p>


<h5>Protected Methods</h5>

<h6>procedure Adopt(const Obj: TCustomOwnedObject); virtual;</h6>

<p>Adopts an owned object from another owned object to this owned object, i.e. it changes
the owner of the specified owned object.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obj<br />The owned object to adopt.</li>
</ul>

<h6>procedure Clear; virtual;</h6>

<p>This procedure (recursively) frees all owned objects and removes them from the list of owned objects.</p>

<h6>function GetOwner: TPersistent; override;</h6>

<p>This function returns the owner of the given object. If the given node has no owner, nil is returned.</p>

<p>Return Value:</p>
<ul>
<li>The owner of the given object or nil if the given object has no owner.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>TCustomOwnedNode = class(TCustomOwnedObject)</h4>

<p>TCustomOwnedNode represents a single node in a tree structure which also maintains a list of sub-nodes. Do not create instances of TCustomOwnedNode. Instead use it to define your own descendant classes. Most of the properties and methods defined in TCustomOwnedNode are protected so that you can choose whether to hide or publish them in your own classes.</p>

<p>The design principle behind the memory management of TCustomOwnedNode is to distinguish between owned nodes and child nodes. Each node can be associated with an owner node in its constructor and contains an ordered list of a (virtually) infinite number of direct child nodes. Each node can only be the child of at most one other node. If a node is the direct child of another node the other node is called "the parent node" of the given node. All direct or indirect parent nodes of a given node are called "its ancestors". This list of child nodes is maintained by the Append(), Insert(), and Remove() methods of the given nodes. Each child node must either have the same owner node as its parent node or the parent node must be identical with the owner node, and an attempt to add a node directly or indirectly as a child node is forbidden.</p>

<p>Each node contains a readonly list of owned nodes which is automatically updated when a node is created with the given node as its owner or if an owned node is freed. When a node is freed, it is removed from its parent node (no matter whether the parent node is readonly or not) and all its child nodes and owned nodes are recursively freed, too. Calling the Clear method of a node recursively frees all of its child nodes (but not the given node itself). It is also possible to specify nil as the owner parameter of a node's constructor. In this case the node has no owner node and the application is responsibly of correctly freeing it.</p>

<h5>Protected Properties</h5>

<h6>Count: Integer (readonly)</h6>

<p>Indicates the number of nodes maintained by the given node.</p>

<h6>FirstChild: TCustomOwnedNode (readonly)</h6>

<p>The first node maintained by the given node or nil if there is no such node.</p>

<h6>Item[Index: Integer]: TCustomOwnedNode (readonly) (default)</h6>

<p>Lists all nodes maintained by the given node. The first node has an index of 0, the second an index of 1, and so on. Item is the default property for TCustomOwnedNode. So the name of the Item property can be omitted when indexing into the set of nodes.</p>

<h6>Items: TList (readonly)</h6>

<p>Provides access to the list of nodes maintained by the given node.</p>

<h6>LastChild: TCustomOwnedNode (readonly)</h6>

<p>The last node maintained by the given node or nil if there is no such node.</p>

<h6>NextSibling: TCustomOwnedNode (readonly)</h6>

<p>The node immediately following the given node. If there is no such node, nil is returned.</p>

<h6>OwnedObject[Index: Integer]: TCustomOwnedObject (readonly) (inherited from TCustomOwnedObject)</h6>

<p>Lists all owned object. The first item has an index of 0, the second an index of 1, and so on.</p>

<h6>OwnedObjectsCount: Integer (readonly) (inherited from TCustomOwnedObject)</h6>

<p>The number of owned objects.</p>

<h6>Parent: TCustomOwnedNode (readonly)</h6>

<p>The parent of the given node or nil if the given node has no parent.</p>

<h6>PreviousSibling: TCustomOwnedNode (readonly)</h6>

<p>The node immediately preceding the given node. If there is no such node, nil is returned.</p>

<h6>ReadOnly: Boolean</h6>

<p>Determines whether the given node is readonly. If the node is readonly any attempt to modify the list of child nodes raises an exception.</p>



<h5>Public Methods</h5>

<h6>constructor Create(const AOwner: TCustomOwnedNode);</h6>

<p>Constructs and initializes an instance of TCustomOwnedNode. If an owner node was specified, Create internally calls the AttachNode() procedure of the specified owner node. During creation the Initializing property of the given node is 'true'.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>AOwner<br />The node that owns the new node or nil if the new node has no owner.</li>
</ul>

<h6>destructor Destroy; override;</h6>

<p>Destroys an instance of TCustomOwnedNode. Before a node is destroyed it is removed from its parent node, then it is cleared, and finally the DetachNode() procedure its owner node (if any) is called. Do not call Destroy directly in an application. Instead, call Free. Free verifies that the TCustomOwnedNode reference is not nil, and only then calls Destroy.</p>


<h5>Protected Methods</h5>
